### **CodeBook**

#### **1. Overview**
This dataset was generated from the Human Activity Recognition dataset collected using smartphones. The purpose of this tidy dataset is to summarize the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

---

#### **2. Source of Data**
- Original dataset: [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)
- Data collected from the accelerometers and gyroscopes of the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

#### **3. Variables**

##### **Identifiers**
1. **Subject**: An integer identifying the subject (1 to 30).
2. **Activity**: The activity performed by the subject. Possible values:
   - WALKING
   - WALKING_UPSTAIRS
   - WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
   - SITTING
   - STANDING
   - LAYING

##### **Measurements**
The dataset contains averaged measurements of the mean and standard deviation for each signal. The variables are summarized as:
1. **tBodyAcc-mean()-X**: Mean of body acceleration signal in the X direction.
2. **tBodyAcc-mean()-Y**: Mean of body acceleration signal in the Y direction.
3. **tBodyAcc-mean()-Z**: Mean of body acceleration signal in the Z direction.
4. **tBodyAcc-std()-X**: Standard deviation of body acceleration signal in the X direction.
5. **tBodyAcc-std()-Y**: Standard deviation of body acceleration signal in the Y direction.
6. **tBodyAcc-std()-Z**: Standard deviation of body acceleration signal in the Z direction.
   *(... and so on for other measurements)*

#### **4. Transformations**
The following transformations were applied to the original dataset to create this tidy dataset:

1. **Merging Data:**
   - Combined the training and test datasets into a single dataset.

2. **Extracting Relevant Measurements:**
   - Retained only measurements on the mean (`-mean()`) and standard deviation (`-std()`) for each signal.

3. **Using Descriptive Activity Names:**
   - Replaced activity codes with descriptive names (e.g., `1` â†’ `WALKING`).

4. **Labeling Dataset:**
   - Variable names were made descriptive by removing special characters and clarifying their meaning.

5. **Creating a Tidy Dataset:**
   - Calculated the average of each variable for each subject and activity combination.
